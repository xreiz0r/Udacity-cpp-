One Way encryptuion and hard-to-replicate output together constitute a document/email's hash fingerprint for
integrity checks against trusted databases sometimes provided by a Certificate Authoritie (CA).
Symmetric encryption relates to using sharing the same key for encryption and decryption while 
asymmetric encryption entails the use of a public and private keys for combined decryption and repudiation capabilities 
of the message's digital signature.
CAs act as a trusted third party that provide the means of checking if the public key is validity,
this is done by tieing an entity's well known credibility to said public key.
